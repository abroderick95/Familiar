I can't sleep, and my big sister has her own room now. It's smaller, right next to mine. I slip out of bed and creep towards the door, trying to avoid the spots where the wood floorboards creak. I turn the curved golden handle down softly; my bedroom door is the loudest in the house, and the hardest to open. Holding the handle down, I pull hard with my right hand, my left hand braced against the door frame to keep it from jolting open with its usual "ker-CHAK." It opens quietly. The door to my sister's room is directly to my left, adjacent to mine. I keep my left foot in my doorway, reaching out with my right to pass over the corner separating us, the floorboards below loud and squeaky. I hold my breath, listening to the dark hallway behind me for the sound of mom, a much lighter sleeper than dad, stirring. Nothing yet. I hop forward, landing softly on the other side, and slide through the whisper-quiet door to my sister's bedroom.
