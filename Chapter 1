I can't sleep... my big sister has her own room now. It's smaller, and right next to mine. 
I slip out of bed and creep towards the door, avoiding the spots where the wood floorboards creak. 
I turn the curved gold handle down softly; my bedroom door is the loudest in the house, and the hardest to open. 
Holding the handle down, I pull hard with my right hand, my left hand braced against the door frame to keep it from jolting open with its usual "ker-CHAK." 
It opens quietly. 
The door to my sister's room is directly to my left, adjacent to mine. 
I hold my breath, keeping my left foot in my doorway, reaching out with my right to pass over the corner separating us. 
The floorboards below are loud and squeaky. 
I listen to the dark hallway behind me for the sound of either of my parents waking. Dad probably won't.
Mom, a light sleeper, could stir at the slightest sound.
Nothing yet. 
I hop forward, toes landing softly on the other side, and slide through the whisper-quiet door to my sister's room. Success.
